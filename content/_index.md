# Howdy! Giovani Zamboni here!

I am a **software engineer** from Brazil specializing in **solving problems** for **tech** companies abroad, **remotely**.

I currently help create platforms that transform data into business opportunities within [TotvsLabs](https://www.totvslabs.com/)' laboratories. I am also a mentor and instructor in the [StartupSC](https://www.startupsc.com.br/) program at Sebrae SC, a program that has been awarded and recognized several times in Brazil and worldwide. In addition, I helped to create [JetBov](https://www.jetbov.com/) as one of the company co-founders and with great pride I had the opportunity to be part of the team of prominent companies such as Datasul (now [Totvs](https://www.totvs.com)), [NeoGrid](https://www.neogrid.com), [ContaAzul](https://contaazul.com) and [Voyager](http://www.voyagerportal.com/).
