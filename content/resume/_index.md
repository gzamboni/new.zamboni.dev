## Summary

I have more than 20 years of experience in computing and information technology. I have had the opportunity to
work in all areas of this market, from developer to sales.

I went through several companies, of all sizes and billings. I can highlight my passages through Datasul,
Sercompe and NeoGrid, where I built a career. I highlight my work at NeoGrid, working together with the team that
transformed the company into a multinational with presence in more than 35 countries.

By appropriating the terms of the startups community, I pivoted my career by joining ContaAzul, being the first
SRE, when there was not yet the term SRE. I had the opportunity to launch the infrastructure bases that allowed
the company to grow.

But the main highlight of my career was helping to create, as the founder of JetBov, a management platform for
the productive chain of bovine animal protein. For 4 years, we have created one of the biggest highlights in the
AgriTech market and certainly the market leader in the livestock management segment. I did my exit in 2018 when
I sold my stocks finishing my mission at JetBov.

I continue to help companies acting as SRI/Dev in several markets, but now I am focused in deliver NLP solutions
as feasible product at Totvs.

Colleagues know me as a smart colleague who can always be trusted to always ask for help. But I know that
rather than just helping, it's teaching others to help each other, teaching them to do their activities better, helping
them to achieve their goals as long as it does not affect my results. I can work well alone, but my best is working
with others.
