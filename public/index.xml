I am also a mentor and instructor in the StartupSC program at Sebrae SC, a program that has been awarded and recognized several times in Brazil and worldwide. In addition, I helped to create JetBov as one of the company co-founders and with great pride I had the opportunity to be part of the team of prominent companies such as Datasul (now Totvs), NeoGrid, ContaAzul and Voyager.</description></item><item><title>Offline</title><link>/offline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/offline/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
